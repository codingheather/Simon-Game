Simon-Game: 

    This game, which tests short-term memory skill, was first created by Ralph H. Baer, Howard J. Morrison, and Lenny Cope. The player need to repeat the sequence after the device showed a series of tones and lights. If the player repeat the sequence successfully, the game will move forward to the next level with a more complex and progressively longer set. Otherwise, the game is over. 

I used HTML for structurizing the game, css for styling, and javascript and jquery for making the game alive.
